# git_guides

This repository is my personal collection of small but detailed guides of how
to perform some more advanced tasks with git.

These guides are written by me and for primarily myself, so I can come back to
these in the future and understand exactly how and why things are done in the
way described. That is why some of these might be considered *way* too
detailed/rambly for most persons, but maybe someone else than me out there will
appreciate it.
